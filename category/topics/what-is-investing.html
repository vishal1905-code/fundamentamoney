<h2>Meaning of Investing</h2>
<p>
Investing means using your money in a smart way so that it can grow over time.
Instead of keeping money idle in a bank account or at home, you put it into
things that can increase its value in the future.
</p>

<h2>How Investing Works</h2>
<p>
When you invest, you give your money to a business, government, or financial
product. That money is then used to create value — such as building companies,
running businesses, or funding projects.
</p>
<p>
Over time, if these activities perform well, your money grows. This growth can
come as profit, interest, or increase in value.
</p>

<h2>Why Investing is Important</h2>
<p>
Simply saving money is not enough because prices of goods increase over time.
This is called inflation. Investing helps your money grow faster than inflation,
so your purchasing power does not decrease.
</p>
