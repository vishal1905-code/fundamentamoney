<h1>Risk vs Return</h1>

<h2>What Does Risk Mean?</h2>
<p>
Risk means the possibility of losing money or not getting the expected return.
In investing, risk exists because the future is uncertain.
</p>

<h2>What Does Return Mean?</h2>
<p>
Return is the profit you earn from an investment. It can come as interest,
dividends, or increase in value.
</p>

<h2>The Core Rule of Investing</h2>
<p>
<strong>Higher return always comes with higher risk.</strong>
There is no investment that gives high return with zero risk.
</p>

<h2>Simple Examples</h2>

<p>
<b>Fixed Deposit (FD):</b><br>
Low risk → Low return
</p>

<p>
<b>Mutual Funds:</b><br>
Medium risk → Medium return
</p>

<p>
<b>Stock Market:</b><br>
High risk → High return potential
</p>

<h2>Why Understanding Risk Is Important</h2>

</p>

<h2>Smart Way to Handle Risk</h2>
<p>
The best way to manage risk is diversification. This means spreading money
across different investments instead of putting everything in one place.
