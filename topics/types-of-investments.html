<h1>Types of Investments (India)</h1>

<h2>Why There Are Different Types of Investments</h2>
<p>
Not all investments work the same way. Some are safer, some give higher returns,
and some are meant for long-term goals. Understanding different types helps you
choose what is right for you.
</p>

<h2>1. Fixed Deposits (FD)</h2>
<p>
Fixed Deposits are offered by banks. You give your money to the bank for a fixed
time, and the bank pays you interest.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low risk</li>
  <li>Returns are fixed</li>
  <li>Good for short-term safety</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Mutual Funds</h2>
<p>
Mutual Funds collect money from many people and invest it in stocks or bonds.
They are managed by professionals.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Medium risk (depends on fund type)</li>
  <li>Better returns than FD in long term</li>
  <li>Good for beginners</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Stock Market (Shares)</h2>
<p>
When you buy shares, you buy ownership in a company. Your return depends on how
well the company performs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>High risk</li>
  <li>High return potential</li>
  <li>Best for long-term investors</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Gold</h2>
<p>
Gold is considered a safe investment in India. It protects money during inflation
and economic problems.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Low to medium returns</li>
  <li>Good for stability</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Government Bonds</h2>
<p>
Government bonds are loans you give to the government. They are very safe but
returns are lower.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very low risk</li>
  <li>Stable returns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Higher return usually means higher risk</li>
  <li>Do not put all money in one place</li>
  <li>Your age and goals matter</li>
  <li>Long-term investing reduces risk</li>
</ul>
